To build the doc with the Doctools Docker image, you have to go in the doc site directory and execute the Docker Compose command.

## Task
First, change to the `template-docsite` directory: `cd template-docsite`{{execute}}.

Then run `docker-compose up`{{execute}}

And you're done!

You can now preview your doc by looking at the live served site at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com
