## What is EthSigner?

EthSigner is an open-source, client-agnostic, Ethereum transaction signer developed under the Apache
2.0 license and written in Java. EthSigner separates private key management from transaction
validation by [signing transactions](Concepts/Overview.md) using a private key that can be secured
in a variety of cloud providers, or encrypted on a local disk.
